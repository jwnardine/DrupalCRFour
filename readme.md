# JONâ€™S DNA AND JAMES BOND SITE

This project is a site which (naturally) includes a module which translates a single DNA helix into its double-helix counter-part, as well as a site which contains news articles on James Bond! The articles utilize an ajax view so that you can click on the article titles in the nav bar when on the James Bond articles page, the individual article content displays on the page without reloading the page.
